// What the band remembers across sessions, in the plugin's own store: when
// each session last had a reply and the model it was billed under, what a
// token costs on each model, the
// layout the band draws in, and a week's worth of limit samples. With the
// first two a reopened session, or a reload, says whether its cache is cold
// and what the next message costs, before any reply of its own, and with the
// samples the week shows the days before this session. What the store leaves
// unknown of a last reply is recalled off the transcript (transcript.ts).
