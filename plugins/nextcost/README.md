# nextcost

The price of your next Claude Code message, before you send it. This Claude
Code plugin draws a calm band above the prompt that answers: is my cache
still warm, what will the next message cost if it isn't, what is this
session costing, and am I close to a limit? It spends no tokens and makes
no network calls. By default it is one row of chips:

![The chip row, labelled: the cache countdown and what a re-warm will cost, the session cost, context toward auto-compaction, the 5-hour limit with its pace, the weekly limit and its reset, and the toggle that opens the cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HMarzban/nextcost/main/docs/band-anatomy.png)

Two more [layouts](#layouts) draw the same readings in other shapes:
`pulse` (the session's trace, for trends) and `departures` (a split-flap
board, for times). Try every state live on the [website](https://hmarzban.github.io/nextcost/),
and see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each version. Found

## Install

```bash
claude plugin install nextcost --marketplace HMarzban/nextcost
```

It loads in your next session, or run `/reload-plugins` in an open one.

The band needs Claude Code with mods (function-hooks plugins). CI tests
every change on 2.1.299 and the latest release (2.1.308 at 0.19.0). The
one-line form needs Claude Code 2.1.292 or later; on an older one, add the
marketplace first (`claude plugin marketplace add HMarzban/nextcost`),
then `claude plugin install nextcost@hossein-mods`.

It draws in the terminal and the desktop app's Code tab, which are the
surfaces with a band above the prompt. WSL sessions don't load plugins. The
[repository README](https://github.com/HMarzban/nextcost/blob/main/README.md)
covers installing inside a session or for a whole team, updating and
uninstalling.

## Settings

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/nextcost` | Toggle visibility |
| `/nextcost more` / `less` | Open or close the expanded view, and show the band if hidden |
| `/nextcost show` / `hide` | Set visibility explicitly |
| `/nextcost layout <name>` | Draw the band in another [layout](#layouts), for every session, and show it if hidden |
| `/nextcost layout` | Name the layout in use and list them all |

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXTCOST_APPEARANCE` | `dark` (default), `light` or `plain`; see [Appearance](#appearance) |
| `NO_COLOR` | Forces `plain` |
| `NEXTCOST_GLYPHS` | `ascii` or `unicode`, in the terminal only; see [Glyphs in the terminal](#glyphs-in-the-terminal) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` | `5m` or `1h`, so the band doesn't guess the cache's lifetime; see [Cache lifetime](#cache-lifetime) |
| `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M=1` | The same, for 5 minutes |
| `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1` | The same, for an hour |

The `promptCacheTtl` setting in settings.json pins the lifetime too; see [Cache lifetime](#cache-lifetime).

Set them in the shell you start Claude Code from (`export NEXTCOST_APPEARANCE=light`,
then `claude`). The band reads them when a session starts. Their names before
0.18.0, `CC_BAND_APPEARANCE` and `CC_BAND_GLYPHS`, still work.

## Reading it

This section describes chips, the default layout; the others are under
[Layouts](#layouts).

| Chip | Shows | Turns amber when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cache | A battery that drains as the cache ages, and the time until it goes cold; `cache warm` while Claude is working, `cache warming` before a new conversation's first reply, `cache –` when the band loaded mid-conversation and hasn't measured it yet | Its last minute: `0:47 left · re-warm ~$0.52` |
| Cost | The session's total so far | Never |
| Context | How full the conversation is toward auto-compaction (`63% full`), or of the model window when compaction is off | Near compaction: `95% full · compacts in ~8k`. Without auto-compaction: 80% (`!`), 95% (`!!`) |
| 5h | Your 5-hour limit: usage on a bar, and the reset | 80%, or when your pace would fill it before it resets: `full in ~40m` |
| 7d | Your weekly limit, the same way | 80% |
| Tokens | Every token this conversation used | Never |

A bar carries one number, the one beside it. Pace is in words, on the
chip when it matters and in the Limits card always.
Once a window's reset time has passed, its chip says `reset` until the next
reply brings a fresh reading.

Amber means act soon. The 5h and 7d chips are tinted green and purple so
you can tell them apart; that's a label, not a warning. Nothing is ever
red: a cold cache or a full meter is a price, not an error. Colour is
never the only signal, since escalation always adds words or `!` / `!!`.

On the desktop (not in `plain`), hover any chip for a one-line
explanation that covers it, so it leads with the chip's figure (`Resets in
3h 00m; 5-hour limit, all your Claude use`). `▵` opens the expanded view.
It starts with a line that says where you are:

```
~/workspace/nextcost · on main                                3 changed · ↑2 ↓1
```

| Piece | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| Path | The project, home as `~`, its folder in bold |
| Branch | The git branch, or `detached at <commit>` |
| Worktree | `worktree of <repo>` in a linked worktree |
| Changes | Files with uncommitted changes, or `clean` |
| Ahead / behind | Commits to push (`↑`) and to pull (`↓`), only when there are any |

On the desktop each piece has an icon and a hover explanation. As the line
narrows, the path and branch shorten and the extras drop, least important
first. When the band is too short to give it a row of its own, it moves
to the footer, beside the buttons, in place of the hint. Outside a
repository, or if git is missing or slow, it shows the path alone. git is read when the session starts, after each of your
messages and when you open the cards, never while the band draws.

Then come four cards with every fact labelled:

![The band expanded on the desktop: chips for the cache, cost, context and the 5h and 7d limits, then the Cache, Spend, Context and Limits cards, the project path and branch, and the Collapse and Hide band buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HMarzban/nextcost/main/docs/band-expanded.png)

| Card | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| Cache | Time left on a bar, what a re-warm would cost if it went cold, what the cache has saved, the hit rate, how long it lasts idle, unexpected rebuilds |
| Spend | The session total, a bar of the token split with its legend (input, output, cache reads), your last message |
| Context | How full toward auto-compaction, tokens in context, where compaction runs, room left, the model window |
| Limits | The window closest to its limit, led by its reset and pace where the row doesn't say them, `resets Sat 13:30 · full before reset` (a countdown in departures); then each window (5h, 7d, a gateway's spend limit) with its bar and value, and each of the others named on a line of its own with its reset and pace in words: `5h resets 3h 00m · on pace for ~10%` |

The cards sit four across when they fit, else two by two, each line sharing
its width equally; on the desktop each has a visible border. A card's title
and headline share its first line, and when the band is short of rows each
card drops its bar first (the chips already show it), then its least
important facts, so the view never scrolls the buttons away. Expanding
never changes the chip row; only the toggle's icon turns from `▵` to `▿`,
pointing the way the band will move.
Below the cards, `Collapse` (key `c`) closes them and `Hide band` (key `h`)
hides the band; `/nextcost` brings it back.

## When the band is narrow

At full width in the terminal, chips' row reads:

```
◷ cache 52m   $3.19   ◔ ██░░░░ 38% full   5h ░░░░░░ 4% │ ↻ 3h 00m   7d ██░░░░ 30% │ ↻ 2d 19h   Σ 225k   ▵
```

On the desktop app's Code tab the glyphs are small icons, but for a
reset's `↻`, and the bars are drawn as SVG meters.

Chips' row stays on one line. As it narrows, pieces give way in this
order: the tokens chip, the 7d reset time, the 5h reset time, the context
meter, a calm 7d chip, the limit bars, long wording, a calm context chip,
then a calm 5h chip. An amber chip keeps its words longest; its reset time
is the very last thing to go. Below about 55 columns, with several chips
amber at once, the end of the row is clipped rather than wrapped.

## Layouts

Chips is one of three layouts. Each asks one question of the same
readings. Chips, the default, opens with `▵` into four cards, Cache,
Spend, Context and Limits; pulse and departures open into views of their
own. All three draw one row collapsed, end it with the same `▵`, and open
with the same `Collapse` and `Hide band` buttons.
Every layout turns amber at the same moments, by the same rules.
Departures' board also says `LAST CALL`, calm, ten minutes before an
hour's cache goes cold; only its last minute is amber. Pulse and
departures draw their readings in one order: cache, spend, context, 5h,
7d. On the desktop, chips explains each pill on hover with its own cards.
Every layout keeps the workspace line, with its hover cards, in the open
view's footer beside `Collapse` and `Hide band`.

</picture>

| Layout | Asks, and shows | Rows (desktop / terminal) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chips` | Is anything wrong right now? The row of chips above: the cache, the spend, the context and the limits at a glance; the default | 1 / 1 |
| `pulse` | Is my cost per message rising, and will a limit fill before it resets? The session's trace, each reading on its own tile: its name, its figure, then its chart, a heartbeat for the cache, each message's cost as a beat, the context and the 5h window over time, and the week by day. The heartbeat is still; only the words and its ink change. Open, four cards like chips', Cache, Spend, Context and Limits, each with its chart: the cache's hour as a track, the beats over their average, the context under its compaction line, the 5h window and the 7d by day | 1 / 1 |
| `departures` | When does the cache go cold, and when does each limit reset or fill? A split-flap board. Collapsed, each reading is its own module on the board's dark ground, its code in its own colour, then its status and time, such as `CACHE DEPARTS 17:24` or `7D 85% RESET SAT 13:30 ! NEAR LIMIT`, amber where it needs you; plain draws no ground, and at its narrowest brackets each reading once, `[7D ! 85%]`. Open, one board headed `DEPARTURES` and the time now, `NOW 20:36`, with quiet ITEM, STATUS, TIME and REMARKS headings: ITEM, STATUS and TIME are flaps, tiles only where there are characters, and the remarks plain text. Short of rows, the remarks give way first on the desktop, then the lines; an amber line never does. Below 60 columns it draws chips | 1 / 1 |

```
/nextcost layout pulse    # draw pulse; /nextcost layout chips goes back
/nextcost layout          # name the layout in use and list them all
```

The choice is kept in the plugin's store, so every session draws it, and
one already open switches after its next reply. Choosing a layout shows a
hidden band. A name it doesn't know changes nothing, and the reply lists
the names. If the store can't keep the choice, the reply says so, and the
layout lasts until Claude's next reply. Below 40 columns every layout
draws chips, and departures does below 60. A layout from an earlier
version that was removed (`gauges`, `ledger`, `rings`, `tiles`, `week` and
`forecast`, gone in 0.14.0) draws chips, and `/nextcost layout` says so.
Week's day cells now live in pulse, and forecast's clock times in
departures.

On the desktop with `NEXTCOST_APPEARANCE=plain` there are no SVG charts,
so a layout draws as text and takes its terminal rows.

Pulse draws its charts in braille in the terminal, always beside their
numbers; its day cells are the desktop's alone. Open and short of rows, a
card's chart steps down, two rows to one to none, before a card gives way,
and an amber card never does. Its day cells for the week come from the 5h and 7d readings the
band keeps in its store from every session, at most one per 15 minutes and
no more than 672, a week's worth, so they cover the days before this
session. As the row narrows, pulse and departures drop calm pieces first:
spend, context and 5h give way, and the cache and the 7d never do.

### Glyphs in the terminal

```bash
NEXTCOST_GLYPHS=ascii     # ASCII alone
NEXTCOST_GLYPHS=unicode   # the band's own glyphs, even in a CJK locale
```

A terminal in a CJK locale draws some of the band's glyphs (`█ │ · Σ …`)
two columns wide where the band counts one, so the row runs past the
window's edge, and so does a terminal set to draw ambiguous-width
characters wide. In a CJK locale (the first of `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE` and
`LANG` that is set starts with `ja`, `zh` or `ko`) the band draws ASCII by
itself. The terminal setting can't be detected, so set
`NEXTCOST_GLYPHS=ascii` if you use it, and with a screen reader, which reads
braille as dots. In ASCII each glyph becomes one character or is dropped
(`█` is `#`, `▵` is `^`, `◷` goes), a ` · ` between two facts reads `, `,
text too long for its room is clipped rather than ended with `…`, and
braille charts give way to their numbers. A wide character, such as a
Japanese project's name, stays, and the band counts it two columns. It applies to every layout,
chips included, and only in the terminal.

### Clock times

Pulse, departures and chips' Limits card name clock times in your local
zone. Each time is read with
the zone's offset in force at it, so a reset past a daylight-saving change
says the clock that will show then, and the band follows a change of
clocks within a minute, with no reply needed. Where the clock gives no
offset, pulse names its days and hours in UTC, and a reset, on the board
and the Limits card too, says how long until it comes rather than when
(`in 52m`, not `14:32`).

## The cache countdown

Claude Code caches the conversation server-side. While the cache is warm,
re-reading the conversation costs a tenth of the normal input price or
less, depending on the model (a twentieth on Opus 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5, a
fortieth on Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1). It
stays warm for a lifetime (5 minutes or an hour) counted from the last
request. Go idle past that, and the next message rebuilds the whole
conversation at the cache-write price, 1.25× input as Claude Code's ledger
counts it. The context part of that message then costs ~25× the warm read
on Opus 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5, ~50× on Fable 5.1 and ~12.5× on Haiku 5.5;
output and new input cost the same either way. In a terminal session on
the hour's cache, Claude Code may compact the conversation first; see
[Idle compaction](#idle-compaction).

The band never suggests sending a message to keep the cache warm. That
would mean burning tokens to avoid burning tokens.

A compaction or a model switch rebuilds the cache on purpose, so neither
counts as an unexpected rebuild.

## Reopening an old session

A session the band hasn't seen a reply in yet, because you reopened it or
the band reloaded, still says what the cache is doing and what it has cost.

When you resume a session (`claude --resume`, `/resume`, or a past session
opened in the desktop app) or fork one, Claude Code says how long it has
been idle, whether its cache has likely expired, and what re-caching it
would cost. The band takes its word: the countdown runs from that idle
time, the cache reads cold when Claude Code says it has likely expired, and
the price shown is Claude Code's own when it gives one. The band also
reads the session's transcript once, never while it draws, for two more
facts:

- What the session spent before you resumed it: its last cost record, and
  each reply logged after it, priced at its model's rate in that record.
  The cost shows that plus what you've spent since resuming, or Claude
  Code's own total if it is larger; the two totals are never added. The
  tokens chip and the Spend card's breakdown count from it too, rather than
  waiting for your next message.
- How long the cache was last written for: an hour or 5 minutes, from the
  last reply in the main conversation that wrote to it. Until the band's
  first reply, the Cache card says `1h idle` or `5m idle` with no
  `· assumed`. A lifetime set in the environment still wins.

Where Claude Code doesn't say, or the band reloaded, it recalls when the
session's last reply was and what a token costs on its model:

- from its own memory, which keeps each session's last reply (the newest 50)
  and the price per token it solved for each model
- for a session from before the band, from the end of that session's
  transcript, read once: the last reply's time and the cost record's
  dollars and tokens

Past the cache's lifetime it shows `cache cold · next message ~$2.34`, the
cost of writing the whole context to the cache again. Within it, the
countdown runs from the last reply. With no price known for the model yet,
it names the tokens instead. With nothing to recall, it stays at `cache –`.

## What a cold cache costs

No pricing table is reachable from a mod, so the rate is solved from the
session's own bill. Each kind of token costs a fixed multiple of base input
(a cache write 1.25×, output 5×, a cache read 0.1×, or 0.05× on Opus 5.5
and Sonnet 5.5 and 0.025× on Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1, per
[Anthropic's pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing)),
which leaves one unknown:

```
cost = r × (uncached + 1.25×written + read share×read + 5×output)
```

where read share is the cache-read multiple above.

Solve for `r`, then price the re-warm as a cache write of the whole
conversation. After a compaction, it prices the summary instead. It's
always shown with `~`.

- **Writes at 1.25×, as Claude Code counts them.** Claude Code's cost
  ledger prices every cache write at 1.25×, so the band does too and agrees
  with the cost it shows. Anthropic bills a 1-hour cache write at 2×, so if
  you pay per token on a 1-hour cache, the real re-warm is up to 1.6× the
  estimate. Paying per token usually means the 5-minute cache, where 1.25×
  is exact.
- **After `/clear`, a resume or a reload,** the rate is solved from what
  the current conversation has spent, not the session's whole ledger.
- **Claude Haiku 5.5 has two price tiers.** A request whose prompt (every
  input token, cache reads and writes included) is over 100,000 tokens pays
  5× every price ($0.50 per million input tokens rather than $0.10)
  ([long context pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing)).
  The band weighs each request at its own tier, so `r` is the lower tier's
  rate, and it prices a re-warm of a conversation over 100k, and what the
  cache saved, at the tier each request paid. A reopened session's cost
  record doesn't say which requests crossed, so there the last reply's
  prompt stands for them all.

## Your pace on the 5-hour limit

The band records your 5-hour usage as it moves. Once it has at least 10
minutes and a 2-point rise to go on, it projects when you'd hit 100%,
using the last 30 minutes. If that's before the limit resets, the chip
says so. The limit is shared across all your Claude use, so the pace
includes your other sessions and devices, and `/clear` keeps it. The
projection hides once its newest reading is more than 15 minutes old.

## Toasts

A toast speaks where a chip turns amber:
- the 5-hour limit at 80% and 95%
- context within 10% of auto-compaction, or at 80% and 95% when
  auto-compaction is off

Each fires once per crossing. The 5h chip also turns amber when your pace
would fill it before it resets; that has no toast, since the projection
moves with every reading.

## Appearance

```bash
NEXTCOST_APPEARANCE=dark    # default: filled pills tuned for dark themes
NEXTCOST_APPEARANCE=light   # filled pills tuned for light themes
NEXTCOST_APPEARANCE=plain   # no backgrounds; every colour a theme key
```

`NO_COLOR` forces `plain`. `plain` has no hover cards and no SVG icons, since
the expanded cards carry the same facts.

## Cache lifetime

The default lifetime depends on billing: an hour on a subscription within
plan usage, five minutes on usage credits or an API key. A mod can't read
which applies, so the band assumes an hour and says `· assumed`. If it
then sees the cache rebuild after a gap longer than five minutes, with the
same model, it corrects itself to `5m`. On a resumed session, the
transcript's last cache write says which until the band's first reply (see
[Reopening an old session](#reopening-an-old-session)).

To remove the guess, set one of these. The band reads them the way Claude
Code does, the first match in this order:
- `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL=5m` or `1h`
- `"promptCacheTtl": "5m"` or `"1h"` in your settings.json
- `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1`

### Idle compaction

In a terminal session on the hour's cache, Claude Code compacts a long
conversation (200k tokens of context by default) that sits idle for about
54 minutes, shortly before its cache would expire. Your next message then
writes a summary instead of the whole conversation
([Claude Code's docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings-reference#idlecompaction)).

While that can happen, the cache's card says so until the 54-minute mark.
The countdown and the re-warm price stay, since Claude Code also needs its
feature flags and an awake computer to do it. Once it has compacted, the
cache reads `compacted`, calm, with what the next message costs to write the
summary; the next reply starts the countdown again. The band follows
`"idleCompaction": false`, `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT`, `DISABLE_COMPACT` and
`CLAUDE_CODE_IDLE_COMPACT_MIN_TOKENS` as Claude Code does. On the desktop,
which doesn't compact while idle, neither shows.

## What it runs, reads and sends

**It sends nothing.** nextcost makes no network calls, never calls a model,
and writes no files. The only web address in its code is the SVG namespace,
`http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`, which every SVG icon it draws declares; nothing
is fetched from it. The one way out a scanner can see is that it starts
programs (`$.process.run`), since a program could reach anywhere. The four
commands below start only `git`, `tail` and `grep`, each reading a local file
or repository and handing its output to the band. None of them is a shell, none is given a
script, and none touches the network.

**It runs four read-only commands**, each named in full where the code calls
it, each given 3 seconds, and never while the band draws:

| Command | Where | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git -c core.fsmonitor=false --no-optional-locks status --porcelain=v2 --branch` | the session's project folder | the workspace line: branch, changes, ahead and behind. It never takes git's index lock. `-c core.fsmonitor=false` is git's own option for setting one value for this run: it stops a repository's config from making git start its fsmonitor program. It starts no shell. |
| `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-dir --git-common-dir --show-toplevel` | the same | whether the folder is a linked worktree, and of which repository |
| `tail -c 1048576 <transcript>` | that session's own transcript under `~/.claude/projects` | only when a conversation is resumed, or the band loads into one it can't tell is new and its own store doesn't know the last reply: when that reply was, so the cache countdown starts from it, and how long its cache was written for |
| `grep -a -b -F '"type":"cost-state"' <transcript>`, then `tail -c +<offset> <transcript>` | the same | only when a conversation is resumed: what it spent before this process, so the session's cost includes it |

**It reads** the session's usage from Claude Code (cost, token counts,
context fill and rate-limit percentages), the clock, the project's folder and
repository root, two keys of your Claude Code settings (`promptCacheTtl` and
`idleCompaction`), and the environment variables in [Settings](#settings),
plus `HOME` to find a transcript and the locale (`LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `LANG`)
for the glyph tier. None of these is a key or a token, and none leaves your
machine. Claude Code hands a mod its settings whole (`$.settings.read`), so
the call takes those two keys where it is made and drops the rest, `env` and
any key or helper in it included. It never reads `~/.claude.json`, your
login, or any credential file; the only file it reads itself is a session's
own transcript, as above. `hooks/kit.tsx` and `hooks/strip.tsx` only draw the
band, and `plugin.json` only names the listing's links: none of them reads a
credential.

**It keeps**, on your machine in the plugin's own store: each session's last
reply time (the newest 50), the price per token it solved for each model, the
layout you chose, and a week of your 5-hour and weekly limit readings, at most
one per 15 minutes. In the session's own state it keeps whether the band is
hidden or open. [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/HMarzban/nextcost/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
lists the same.

**What each hook does.** Every hook passes Claude Code's event on unchanged;
none edits a message, a setting, a tool call or a result.

| Hook | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `session.start` | Starts a once-a-second timer that repaints only when the drawing would change and registers `/nextcost` (and its old name, `/usage-band`), then resets the band and reads its settings, stored layout and limit readings. Loaded into a conversation it can't tell is new, it recalls the last reply, from its store or the transcript's end as above. |
| `session.end` | On `/clear` or a resume, starts the next conversation's count. |
| `classic.SessionStart` | On a resume or fork, notes that the conversation isn't new and reads its transcript as above. |
| `turn.start`, `turn.complete` | Note the session's cost as each main turn starts and ends, the turn's cost, the context, and a limit reading; then read the layout and git again. A subagent's turn is left alone. |
| `turn.step` | Reads each response's token counts, for the cache model and the price per token. |
| `session.compact` | Notes that the conversation was compacted, so the cache counts as rebuilt at the summary's size. |
| `session.measure` | Reads where auto-compaction runs, and shows a toast as the context or the 5-hour limit crosses its warning levels. |
| `command.run` | Answers `/nextcost` and `/usage-band`, and no other command. |
| `ui.render` (above the prompt) | Draws the band; steps aside while a survey holds the space or the band is hidden. |
