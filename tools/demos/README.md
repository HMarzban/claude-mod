# Demos

Everything in `docs/` that shows the band is drawn from the band's own output:
the film, the terminal GIF, the landing page's live band and its states, the
social card and the stills. Nothing is mocked up.

```bash
tools/demos/build.sh            # rebuild everything into docs/ (about two minutes)
tools/demos/build.sh capture    # only re-capture the band's frames
```

It needs Claude Code, Google Chrome, Node 22+, Python 3 with Pillow, and ffmpeg.
It uses the first `python3` it finds that can import Pillow; set
`PYTHON=/path/to/python3` to choose one.

## How it works

1. **Capture.** `capture/*.test.ts` are not tests. The build runs them in a
   scratch copy of the plugin with one `claude plugin test` and keeps what
   they print: the band's drawn tree at each moment, with the clock moved
   forward and the session in a known shape. The site's live demo is its own
   set (`DEMO <layout> <state> <shut|open> <tree>` lines, kept in
   `out/demo.txt`): four states, each one session and clock drawn in all
   three layouts, so switching layout never changes a figure.
2. **Draw.** `render.py` turns a terminal tree into HTML on a monospace grid;
   `render_desk.py` turns a desktop tree into HTML laid out like the Code tab
   (10px per column, 24px per text row), with the band's real SVG icons.
   Both map a Box's flex props through `common.py`, which the scripts share
   for the capture's lines, a tree's text and the plugin's version.
3. **Compose.** `film.py` builds the film frame by frame in a light and a
   dark theme; `term_themed.py` the terminal demo; `gen_site.py` fills
   `site/template.html` with the live demo's drawings (`{{demo-chips-amber}}`
   and `{{demo-json}}`, drawn with `node(tree, site=True)`: real buttons,
   `alt=""` icons, the countdown in `<span class=cd>`); `stills.py` the
   social card (from the real `chips amber` drawing), the chip row's anatomy,
   the expanded band, and the states and layouts galleries. The build also
   stamps `docs/sitemap.xml`'s `lastmod` with the build date (UTC).
4. **Render.** `shoot.mjs` screenshots each frame through one headless Chrome
   over the DevTools protocol; ffmpeg turns frames into MP4 and GIF.
5. **Cache-bust.** Last, `cachebust.py` gives every local asset
   `docs/index.html` names (the icons, the social card in `og:image`,
   `twitter:image` and the JSON-LD, the film and its posters) a `?v=` of its
   SHA-256's first 10 hex digits, from the files as the build left them. A
   changed file gets a new URL, so no cache keeps the old one: browsers'
   long-lived favicon stores and link-preview caches included. Running it
   again changes nothing.

To change the landing page, edit `site/template.html` and run the build (or
just `python3 gen_site.py out/site.txt site/template.html ../../docs/index.html`
then `python3 cachebust.py ../../docs/index.html ../../docs` after a capture). Don't edit `docs/index.html` by hand; the build overwrites it.

Scratch goes to `tools/demos/out/`, which git ignores.
